We're using [Magic](https://magic.link/) and
[Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/) for our user authentication.

# Why?

* They're free.
* We don't store any user details beyond an email address.
* There's no user management/admin to do because we don't manage users.

# Magic

* Here's the [admin dashboard](https://dashboard.magic.link/login).
